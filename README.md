# CurrencyConverter

## Description:

This is simple currency converter that is default USA dollar and converts it into either Qatari Rial, Singapore Dollar, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Pounds Sterling and Euros. As I get better at coding this will be improved over time and the fixed currency rates will update to date according to google.com
